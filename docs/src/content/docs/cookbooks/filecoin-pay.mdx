## What is Filecoin Pay?

Filecoin Pay transforms how Web3 services get paid. A token agnostic payment system that supports payment flows through "rails" - automated payment channels between payers and recipients. Filecoin Pay supports continuous rate based payments, one-time transfers, and payment validation during settlement.

**Before Filecoin Pay:**

- Manual invoicing and payments
- Trust-based service agreements
- No automatic quality enforcement
- No support for streaming payments using native tokens

**With Filecoin Pay:**

- Continuous, automatic payments
- Cryptographic guarantees and verifiable delivery
- Programmable quality checks with instant consequences
- Supports both streaming and one-time payments
- Supports native token streaming

The real innovation isn't just streaming payments - it's enabling **trustless business relationships** where math and code enforce agreements, eliminating the need for intermediaries and manual oversight.

## Core Concepts

### Payment Rails

A "payment rail" is like setting up an automated pipeline between two parties. Instead of making manual payments every month, you establish a continuous flow that moves funds automatically at a steady rate.

**Traditional one-time payment:**
You manually send $100 to a friend once.

**Filecoin Pay payment rail:**
You set up an automatic stream of $100/month for 3 months. Payments flow continuously without any manual intervention, with built-in guarantees that protect both parties.

### Lockup

Unlike traditional escrow systems that lock funds away completely, Filecoin Pay uses a "lockup" mechanism that reserves funds while keeping them in your account.

Think of it like a credit card authorization at a hotel:

- The hotel reserves $200 on your card for incidentals
- The money stays in your account and isn't charged yet
- You can still use the rest of your balance freely
- The reservation protects the hotel while giving you flexibility

**Benefits:**

- Recipients get payment guarantees without full escrow
- Payers maintain access to their funds
- More capital efficient than traditional escrow systems

### Three-Party Model

Filecoin Pay supports a flexible three-party structure:

1. **Payer**: The account owner who has funds and sets spending limits
2. **Payee**: The service provider who receives automatic payments
3. **Operator**: A smart contract service (or the payer themselves) that manages payment rails on the payer's behalf

### Epochs and Time

Filecoin Pay measures time in "epochs" - roughly 30-second intervals on the Filecoin blockchain. Payment rates are specified per-epoch:

- 1 month ≈ 86,400 epochs
- 1 day ≈ 2,880 epochs

This granular timing enables smooth, continuous payment flows rather than large periodic transfers.

### Validators

Validators are optional quality-checking mechanisms that can verify service delivery before releasing payments. They can:

- Verify uptime and performance metrics
- Check proof-of-work or proof-of-delivery
- Implement custom business logic
- Adjust or block payments based on service quality

## How It Works: A Simple Example

**Scenario**: Bob wants to pay Alice $500/month for the next 3 months.

**The Setup:**

1. Bob deposits funds into the payment system
2. Bob creates a payment rail to Alice specifying:
   - Payment rate: $500/month
   - Duration: 3 months (lockup period)
   - Optional validator for quality checks
3. Payments begin flowing automatically from Bob to Alice

**What Happens:**

- Bob's account shows $1,500 locked (3 months × $500)
- Funds continuously accumulate in Alice's account
- Alice can collect (settle) payments at any time
- No manual intervention needed - it's fully automatic

**The Result:**

- Bob doesn't need to remember monthly payments
- Alice gets guaranteed, predictable income
- Both parties have on-chain proof of payment history

## What You Can Build: Advanced Patterns

Filecoin Pay power comes from combining payment rails with custom validators that check service quality. Here are the key patterns that enable sophisticated Web3 applications.

- **Off-Chain Service Verification (via Gelato Functions)**

  **What it does:** Uses oracle networks to verify off-chain services (APIs, web services, databases) and trigger on-chain payments based on real-world performance.

  **Use cases:**
  - Web hosting services that pay based on actual uptime
  - API providers compensated for response time and availability
  - Content delivery networks with performance-based pricing

  **How it works:** Automated checks run periodically (every hour, for example) to query your service's health endpoint. Results are stored on-chain and used to calculate payments. If uptime is 95%, you receive 95% of the full payment.

  **Benefits:** Trustless verification of off-chain services without manual reporting.

---

- **Verifiable Computation (via Zero-Knowledge Proofs)**

  **What it does:** Requires cryptographic proofs of correct computation or data processing without revealing the underlying data.

  **Use cases:**
  - Privacy-preserving data processing services
  - Verifiable AI model inference without exposing models
  - Trustless computation marketplaces

  **How it works:** Service providers submit zero-knowledge proofs at regular intervals proving they performed the agreed-upon work. Payments are proportional to proof submission - if you submit 8 out of 10 required proofs, you receive 80% payment.

  **Benefits:** Verify work was done correctly without accessing private data or proprietary algorithms.

---

- **Service Level Agreement (SLA) Enforcement**

  **What it does:** Automatically enforces uptime and performance requirements with graduated penalties.

  **Use cases:**
  - Cloud services with 99.9% uptime guarantees
  - API providers with response time requirements
  - Hosting services with availability commitments

  **How it works:** Define specific targets (e.g., 99% uptime, 100ms response time) with grace periods. Initial violations are free, but repeated failures trigger automatic payment reductions. Hit your targets, get full pay. Miss them, face proportional penalties.

  **Benefits:** Self-enforcing contracts that don't require dispute resolution or manual intervention.

---

- **Progressive Penalty System**

  **What it does:** Implements escalating consequences for repeated failures with automatic circuit breakers.

  **Use cases:**
  - Critical infrastructure requiring high reliability
  - Services where repeated failures indicate serious problems
  - Quality control with increasing stakes

  **How it works:** First failure = 10% penalty. Third failure = 25% penalty. Fifth failure = 50% penalty. After 10 failures, payments stop completely (circuit breaker). Success resets the counter. This encourages quick problem resolution while protecting against persistent issues.

  **Benefits:** Balances tolerance for occasional issues with protection against systemic problems.

---

- **Time-Weighted Quality Scoring**

  **What it does:** Maintains a quality score that decays over time and adjusts based on recent performance.

  **Use cases:**
  - ML model serving with accuracy metrics
  - Content delivery with user satisfaction scores
  - Dynamic reputation systems for service providers

  **How it works:** Your quality score starts at 100. Each measurement updates the score using exponential moving average - recent performance matters more than old data. The score naturally decays if not updated, incentivizing consistent performance. Payments scale directly with score.

  **Benefits:** Recent performance matters most, encouraging continuous quality improvement.

---

- **Milestone-Based Settlement**

  **What it does:** Releases payments only when specific deliverables are completed and verified.

  **Use cases:**
  - Software development contracts with feature milestones
  - Grant funding with deliverable requirements
  - Project-based work with staged payments

  **How it works:** Define milestones upfront with proof requirements. Complete milestone 1, submit proof, receive payment 1. No shortcuts - you must complete milestones in order. Payments are locked until proof is verified.

  **Benefits:** Clear expectations, provable delivery, automatic payment on completion.
